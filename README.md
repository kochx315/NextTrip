# NextTrip

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Assumptions made during development

- This application would be used by MetroTransit, so MetroTransit logos were used.
- The functionality would need to be similar to [MetroTransit's NexTrip](https://www.metrotransit.org/nextripbadge.aspx)
- The [provided endpoints](https://svc.metrotransit.org/nextrip/help) did not work directly, so I used the similar endpoints from [here](https://svc.metrotransit.org/nextrip)
